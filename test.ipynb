    "The shape of `triangles.npy` is (334139, 3) and the shape of `vertices.npy` is (2, 201640).\n",

    "*   There are 334,139 triangles.\n",
    "*   Each triangle is defined by 3 vertex indices.\n",
    "*   There are 201,640 vertices.\n",
    "*   For each vertex, there are 2 coordinates (presumably longitude and latitude).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the `vertices` array shape `(2, 201640)` is a bit unusual for typical usage with Matplotlib's `tripcolor` or similar functions, which usually expect vertices as `(num_vertices, num_dimensions_per_vertex)`, e.g., `(201640, 2)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We should load and inspect `vertices.npy` to confirm its structure and transpose it if necessary before using it for plotting. The salinity data (or any data to be visualized on the mesh) should have a value for each of these 201,640 vertices."
